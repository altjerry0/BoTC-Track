## [v1.0.4] - 2025-May-08

### Fixed
- Corrected username history modal to properly display names from history entries using the `username` key, resolving the 'Unknown Change' bug.
- Eliminated "Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist." console errors by removing a superfluous `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` listener in `background.js`.

### Changed
- Aligned the extension title and the "Open in Tab" button on the same row in the popup interface for improved layout.

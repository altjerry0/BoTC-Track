## Code Organization

The codebase is organized into modular components:

- **User Management**: Handles player data, ratings, and username history tracking
- **Session Management**: Processes session data and displays active games
- **UI Components**: Creates dynamic interface elements for sessions and players

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the `botc-extension` directory (inside `botcraterdev`).
5. The extension should now be loaded and ready for use.

## Release Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the creation of release ZIP files.

1.  **Update Version**: Before creating a release, update the `"version"` in `botc-extension/manifest.json`.
2.  **Commit Changes**: Commit the updated `manifest.json` and any other code changes for the release.
    ```bash
    git add botc-extension/manifest.json
    git commit -m "Prepare release vX.Y.Z"
    git push
    ```
3.  **Tag the Release**: Create and push a Git tag matching the version (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`). This will trigger the GitHub Action.
    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```
4.  **Download ZIP**: The workflow will create a GitHub Release and attach the packaged `botc-tracker-X.Y.Z.zip` file to it. This ZIP is ready for upload to the Chrome Web Store.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **View Active Sessions**:
   - Navigate to botc.app
   - Click the extension icon to open the popup
   - Click "Fetch Active Games" on the "Sessions" tab.

2. **Manage Players**:
   - Click the "Manage Users" tab.
   - View the list of known players.
   - Use the search field to filter players by current/previous usernames, notes, or score.
   - Click the edit icon (pencil) to update a player's score or notes.
   - Click the delete icon (trash can) to remove a player.
   - Click the star icon to toggle a player's favorite status.

3. **Add/Update Players**:
   - **From Session**: In the "Sessions" tab, expand a session's player list and click "Add Player".
   - **Manually**: In the "Manage Users" tab, click "Add Player Manually" and provide ID, name, score, and notes.

4. **View Username History**:
   - In the "Manage Users" tab, click on the history icon (clock) next to a player's name (if available).

5. **Import/Export Data**:
   - In the "Manage Users" tab, use the "Export Players (CSV)" and "Import Players (CSV)" buttons.

## Future Improvements

- **Security**: Better token storage and expiration handling
- **Error Handling**: Improved retry logic and error boundaries
- **Performance**: Replace polling with an event-based system
- **Code Organization**: Further modularization and TypeScript integration
- **UX Improvements**: Loading states and user feedback
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests

## Current Status & Known Issues

Several features are currently under development or require fixes:

*   **Unique Session Tracking:** The logic to track the number of unique game sessions a player has participated in is incomplete and does not function correctly.
*   **Favorite User Filtering:** The feature to filter the user list to show only favorited players needs to be implemented or fixed.

# BotC Player Tracker Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension tracks and rates players in Blood on the Clocktower (BotC) games, helping you recognize familiar players across sessions and track username changes.

⚠️ **Important: Back Up Your Player Data!** ⚠️

Your player ratings, notes, and history are stored locally by this extension. If you uninstall the extension, this data will be **permanently deleted** by Chrome.

🛡️ **To keep your data safe or transfer it to another computer:**

*   **ALWAYS use the "Export Players (CSV)" button** (found in the "Manage Users" tab) to save your data to a file **before** uninstalling or if you want a backup.
*   You can use the "Import Players (CSV)" button to restore your data from a previously saved CSV file.

Regularly exporting your data is a good habit!

## Installation

The easiest way to install the BotC Player Tracker is by using the latest release ZIP file.

1.  **Download the latest release:**
    *   Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/altjerry0/BoTC-Track/releases)
    *   Download the `botc-tracker-vX.Y.Z.zip` file from the latest release.
2.  **Unzip the file:** Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer. You should see a folder named `botc-extension` (or similar, containing `manifest.json`).
3.  **Load into Chrome:**
    *   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
    *   Click on **Load unpacked**.
    *   Select the folder you unzipped in step 2 (the one containing `manifest.json`).
4.  The extension should now be loaded and ready to use! Pin it to your toolbar for easy access.

(For developers looking to load from source, see the [Developer Setup / Loading from Source](#developer-setup--loading-from-source) section below.)

## Code Organization

The codebase is organized into modular components:

- **User Management**: Handles player data, ratings, and username history tracking
- **Session Management**: Processes session data and displays active games
- **UI Components**: Creates dynamic interface elements for sessions and players

## Usage Guidelines

1. **View Active Sessions**:
   - Navigate to botc.app
   - Click the extension icon to open the popup
   - Click "Fetch Active Games" on the "Sessions" tab.

2. **Manage Players**:
   - Click the "Manage Users" tab.
   - View the list of known players.
   - Use the search field to filter players by current/previous usernames, notes, or score.
   - Click the edit icon (pencil) to update a player's score or notes.
   - Click the delete icon (trash can) to remove a player.
   - Click the star icon to toggle a player's favorite status.

3. **Add/Update Players**:
   - **From Session**: In the "Sessions" tab, expand a session's player list and click "Add Player".
   - **Manually**: In the "Manage Users" tab, click "Add Player Manually" and provide ID, name, score, and notes.

4. **View Username History**:
   - In the "Manage Users" tab, click on the history icon (clock) next to a player's name (if available).

5. **Import/Export Data**:
   - In the "Manage Users" tab, use the "Export Players (CSV)" and "Import Players (CSV)" buttons.

## Future Improvements

- **Security**: Better token storage and expiration handling
- **Error Handling**: Improved retry logic and error boundaries
- **Performance**: Replace polling with an event-based system
- **Code Organization**: Further modularization and TypeScript integration
- **UX Improvements**: Loading states and user feedback
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests

## Current Status & Known Issues

Several features are currently under development or require fixes:

*   **Unique Session Tracking:** The logic to track the number of unique game sessions a player has participated in is incomplete and does not function correctly.
*   **Favorite User Filtering:** The feature to filter the user list to show only favorited players needs to be implemented or fixed.

## Developer Setup / Loading from Source

These instructions are for developers or users who want to load the extension directly from the source code instead of using a release ZIP.

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the `botc-extension` directory (located inside the `botcraterdev` project root).
5. The extension should now be loaded and ready for use.

## Release Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the creation of release ZIP files.

1.  **Update Version**: Before creating a release, update the `"version"` in `botc-extension/manifest.json`.
2.  **Commit Changes**: Commit the updated `manifest.json` and any other code changes for the release.
    ```bash
    git add botc-extension/manifest.json
    git commit -m "Prepare release vX.Y.Z"
    git push
    ```
3.  **Tag the Release**: Create and push a Git tag matching the version (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`). This will trigger the GitHub Action.
    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```
4.  **Download ZIP**: The workflow will create a GitHub Release and attach the packaged `botc-tracker-X.Y.Z.zip` file to it. This ZIP is ready for upload to the Chrome Web Store or Local Installation.
